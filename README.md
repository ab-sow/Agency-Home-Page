## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex



### What I learned

i have learned new things and refresh my old knowledge specially on flex alignment and centering.

the new thing i have learned on this project is color overlay on background picture and i did that using css box-border


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(137, 26, 201, 0.5);
}
```



### Continued development
